This file is meant to be imported by the examples, to give them access to the `sql_equiv` tactic.
This file would contain all dependencies imported, to give all theorems and definitions for `simp` and `grind` to work in `sql_equiv`.

/-- `sql_simp` — the normalisation pass: unfold the `@[simp]` query/operator definitions and
fire the `@[simp]`-tagged database identities, using local hypotheses (`simp_all`) to discharge
side-conditions like `t ∈ table`. It puts a goal in a shape `grind` can finish. -/

Creating a `sql_equiv` tactic to prove equivalences between SQL queries, by doing `simp` and `grind` using definitions produced and grinding on locals.

Idea is to use JUST this tactic to prove equivalences between SQL queries.

Possible future work: extend this tactic to also be able to disprove using `plausible` (counterexample search).

     | refine Finset.image_congr (fun _ _ => ?_)
     | sql_simp)
   all_goals (first
     | grind +locals
     | (apply Finset.ext; sql_simp; grind +locals))))
