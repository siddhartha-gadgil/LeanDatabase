# `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`

Our relations are `Finset`s — **inherently unordered**. So neither operator can be modelled
faithfully as "produce rows in some order":

* **`ORDER BY`** is therefore the **identity**. Under set semantics two queries are equivalent iff
  they yield the same *set* of rows; sorting is a *presentation* concern that set-equivalence
  deliberately ignores. We keep the operator (so queries read naturally and the sort key is
  documented) but it provably changes nothing — see `orderBy_eq`.

* **`LIMIT k`** cannot pick *which* `k` rows survive without an order, so the only thing it can
  observe is **cardinality**. We model it as the identity too, and expose the cardinality contract
  (`limit_card`, `limit_noop_of_card_le`): `LIMIT k` is a genuine no-op exactly when the table
  already fits the bound (`card ≤ k`), which is the only regime an order-free model can decide.
  (A faithful "keep `k` of `n`" needs the ordered `List`-relation layer; that is future work.)

equal to itself. The `key` argument is opaque too (S1 fix): under a `LIMIT` the sort key selects the
surviving rows, so it must not be erased — `ORDER BY a LIMIT k` and `ORDER BY b LIMIT k` must stay
unequal. (A bare `LIMIT` gets a canonical Unit key.) -/
