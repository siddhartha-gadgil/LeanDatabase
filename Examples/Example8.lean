# Example 8 — `NOT IN` ≡ `NOT EXISTS` (anti-join)

Keep the customers with no orders. The negative counterpart of Example 5; both are a
`restriction` of `customers` whose predicates agree by `TypedAgg.grp_nonempty_iff`.
(NULL-free / dedup'd data, so the real-SQL `NOT IN` NULL pitfall does not arise.)

## The two SQL queries being proved equivalent

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers c WHERE c.customer_id NOT IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders);
SELECT * FROM customers c WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id);
```
