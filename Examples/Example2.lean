# Example 2 — Cascading selection (the "Index Merge" rewrite)

Two `WHERE` filters applied one after another equal a single filter testing both conditions
at once. A planner uses this to collapse a multi-pass scan into one pass (or a single
composite index seek).

## The two SQL queries being proved equivalent

```sql
-- query_MultiPass: filter for active, then filter that result for high value (two passes)
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT * FROM r WHERE is_active
) WHERE is_high_value;

-- query_SinglePass: test both conditions in one pass
SELECT * FROM r WHERE is_high_value AND is_active;
```
