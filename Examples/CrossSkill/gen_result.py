"""Regenerate result.json from the CrossSkill instance files + the dataset.

MERGE semantics (so we don't re-judge prior work): the existing result.json's instances are the
source of truth and are PRESERVED; on-disk `Sf*.lean` files that are NOT already recorded are added
as new entries (crude auto-classification: an active `sql_equiv`/theorem ⇒ pass, else out_of_scope).
The recorded count is therefore "previously-judged + new incomers". (A proper re-judge of changed
files is left for later — see the note in the header.)

outcome values: pass | pass_under_hypothesis | out_of_scope | fail.
