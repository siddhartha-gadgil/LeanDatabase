# Example 12 — `SUM(CASE…)` + `HAVING` ≡ `WHERE` + `SUM` + `HAVING`

Filtering inside the aggregate with `CASE` equals filtering rows with `WHERE` before
aggregating — so the planner may push `status = 'completed'` into a `WHERE`.

## The two SQL queries being proved equivalent

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN total_amount ELSE 0 END) AS completed_total
FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN total_amount ELSE 0 END) > 1000;
                                  ≡
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS completed_total
FROM orders WHERE status = 'completed' GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(total_amount) > 1000;
```

The two `GROUP BY`s scan *different* base relations (all orders vs. the completed ones), so beyond the
per-group `SUM(CASE)`≡`WHERE`+`SUM` value identity (`groupSum_caseProp_eq_groupSum_where`) the proof
also matches their output key-sets: a customer survives `HAVING SUM > 1000` only if it has a completed
order (`mem_groupKeys_of_groupSum_ne_zero`), which is exactly `image_where_absorb`.
